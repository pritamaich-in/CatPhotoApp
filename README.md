# CatPhotoApp

This is is a simple CatPhotoApp - only HTML is used.

This app's tutorial is available on - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/

Although I already had some hands-on experience with HTML, it was a good quick revision, and i have learnt some more tags and attributes:
- section tag
- figure & figcaption tags
- fieldset & legend tags
- label tag & for attribute
- required & checked attributes for input tag
